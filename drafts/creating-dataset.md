## Creating a Machine Learning dataset

There are many resources available
for understanding machine learning methods,
and learning to apply them to existing datasets.
But for many practical problems where ML could be useful,
the relevant datasets do not exist yet.
How to build such a dataset?

This presentation will cover the basics of creating
a dataset for machine learning, from start to finish.
From designing the data capture process,
to annotating, to curating a cleaned up dataset.
We will use open-source tools for each step of the way.

This talk is based on some of the experiences we had
at Soundsensing when creating our datasets for
Noise Monitoring and Condition Monitoring.
