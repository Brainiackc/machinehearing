# Proposal

## Recognizing sounds with Machine Learning and Python

### Abstract
Sound is a rich source of information about the world around us with many applications within music and speech domains, as well as specific tasks in industry and science.

This talk will show you how to build practical models for sound classification, using Convolutional Neural Networks on audio spectrograms.
Tricks for dealing with small amounts of data will also be covered, including transfer learning, audio embeddings and data augmentation.

A basic understanding of machine learning is recommended.
