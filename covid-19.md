# Acoustic Detection of COVID-19

Especially interesting as an early-onset detection and screening. 

## Research papers

- June 20, 2020. [Exploring Automatic Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Crowdsourced Respiratory Sound Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05919v1). Chloë Brown et.al, Cambride University.
Crowdsourced dataset of respiratory sounds
Used low-level acoustical features , and MFCCs.
To date 10,000 samples from about 7000 unique users.
Tested cough classification into COVID-19 positive/negative. AUC ROC over 70%.
Also tested using breathing sounds.
