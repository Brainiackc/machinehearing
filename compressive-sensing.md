# Compressed sensing
Aka compressive sensing.

Family of signal processing methods that allow efficient aquisition and reconstruction of sparse signals.

Avoids having to sample at very high frequencies when the information of interest is

This is of special interest to battery-powered continious-monitoring systems,
where aquisition can be a bottleneck in power consumption.

## Introduction

[Compressed Sensing: The big picture](https://sites.google.com/site/igorcarron2/cs).
Acquiring and recovering a sparse signal in the most efficient way possible (subsampling) with the help of an incoherent projecting basis.
Buildling sensing hardware that can directly produced such compressed signals.
Sparse means signal of interest is compressible. Challenge: Need to know with which family of functions it is sparse.
Fourier,polynomials,wavelets.
Many approaches to finding sparse representations/sparse dictionaries. Page lists 11.
Donoho-Tanner phase transition diagram, tool for evaluating whether a signal is compressible with an L1 solver.
Lists a set of 10 different conditions needed to enable sparse recovery.
Lists some 40 different solvers, until 2013.

2011, Vishal M. Patel. `TODO: review`
Compressive Sensing (CS), Sparse Representation (SR) and Dictionary Learning (DL). 
Recent works in SR and CS have shown that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed then the choice of features is less critical.
What becomes critical, however, is the number of features and the sparsity of representation.

References two other papers about compressed sensing in audio compression.
To obtain exact recovery, the rule of thumb is to apply incoherent sampling and taking measurements 4 times the sparsity level of the signal.
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit one algorithm for doing recovery.
Sparse Fast Fourier Transform can transform in sub-linear time.
Binning Fourier coefficients into a small number of buckets.
The recovery process reduces to extracting the location of the non-zero (index) elements in the matrix A and use them to order the sparse K signal, embed zeros in the other locations and perform inverse FFT.
Considerably simpler than the general compressed sensing case.
Propose an innovative way to embed the indices in the extracted largest frequency bins to relax the need for extra coded values.
