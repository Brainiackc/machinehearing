## Talk 1

DTU. Danish Technical University

Demo. DANSpeech system


Safe AI.
Trustworthy.
Explainable AI.

! New book. Explainable AI, Interpreting Explaining and Visualizing Deep Learning

DUT. Introduction to ML. 1000 engineering students per year. 

Close collaboration with Hearing Systems.
ML used quite a bit.
Early patenting.

DABAI. Open source ML workflow.
Danish language.


Data and Representation

- Division of labor.
- Neural network. Simple units.
Reused in different contexts.
- Learning. Adaptivity, Plasticity
- Attention

What is it we attend to?
Race to short term memory

Looking for things that "move indepdendetly"


Paper.
Lewincki, 2002. Efficient Coding of natural sounds.
Adapted ICA in primarly audidotury.
Mel MFCC

How to model this independence?

Comparing generative/unsupervised with supervised learning

Train independently. Are they similar?

? how do they estimate the similarity. Mutual information?

Ling Feng.

! can predict height of person based on their speech

ICLR2016.
Convergent Learning.
Do different neural networks learn the same representation?
Authors suggest Yes!

! Controversial paper 

Neural networks are permutation invariant.

## Talk 2

WS Audiology

Started PhD in 2015
Everyone talks about "Big Data"

Dreams about future in 2017

Rule-based system -> Data driven
Opinion-based decision -> Fact-based
Increasing system/use complexity -> Simple, intutive

Prerequisites

- Data Collection
- Data Warehousing
- High performance Compute
- Machine Learning


### SoundSense Learn

Mobile app.
Allows to play around with personalized aud
Primarily for hearing aid tuning
Compares 2-and-2 settings

Using Baysian optimization for Active Learning

Jensen et. al 2019


### Data Infrastructure

From Lake to Warehouse

Go from lots of unstructured data. Independent.
To lower amount of strucutred data. Inter-linked. Contextualized.



## Talk 3

Eriksholm Research Center

```
Audio Enhancment
+ Preferences
= new  services for hearing in healthcare
```

Hearing aids

Source separation

! want to do it on hearing aid hardware
! with 8-10 millisecond latency

Single microphone
For more than 2 people need directionality

Competition?
Hearables. Will get more crowded

Training?
Audio-Visual correspondence

EVOTIUM Consurtiom


### Privacy perserving

Temporal
1 sample per minute

SPL 3 bands
Noise floor.

Environment Classification. 
Quiet, Noise, Speech, Noisy Speech

EOTOION Hearing Aid data

51 million datapoints
1000 users

? is some of this dataset available

5 M parameters
